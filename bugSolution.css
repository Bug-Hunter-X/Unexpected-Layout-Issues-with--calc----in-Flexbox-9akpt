To resolve this, explicitly set the container's width using a fixed or percentage value.  Alternatively, consider using flex-basis or other flexbox properties to control the item's size more predictably, avoiding `calc()` if possible.  If `calc()` is absolutely necessary, ensure that the container's dimensions are well-defined and that the calculation is compatible with the flexbox layout.
